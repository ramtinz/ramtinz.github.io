## Can one toolbox solve the tedious parts of medical machineâ€‘learning?

*How do you handle tabular clinical data with dozens of risk factors, mixed variable types and a fair amount of missing values?*  
*Which model â€“ a logistic regression, a random forest or something deeper â€“ performs best for survival prediction on your real-world dataset?*  
*How do you explain your modelâ€™s decision to your PI, clinician collaborators, and reviewers?*  
*Whatâ€™s the threshold that optimizes your decision-making? How confident are you about it?*  
*Can you avoid writing 500 lines of preprocessing, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning and calibration code â€“ again?*

If these questions sound familiar, **MAIT** might be a tool worth knowing.

## ðŸ§° What is MAIT?

[MAIT](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIT) (Medical Artificial Intelligence Toolbox) is a streamlined, opinionated machine-learning pipeline built to simplify and standardize predictive modeling in medical research. It is designed for domain scientists and ML engineers alike, aiming to balance flexibility, interpretability, and reproducibility.

MAIT tackles common tasks in health data science:

- binary classification
- survival prediction
- regression
- semi-supervised learning for censored data

If youâ€™re building predictive models in healthcare, itâ€™s worth giving MAIT a try.
