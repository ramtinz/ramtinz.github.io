I'm a senior data scientist and research engineer with a PhD in biomedical engineering from **Aalborg University, Denmark** (adjunct PhD program with **Grenoble University, France**).  My academic journey began with a **BSc in electrical engineering**, followed by an **MSc in biomedical engineering**.  These degrees have provided a strong foundation in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and biomedical engineering.


Over the past decade I have contributed to designing and developing numerous AI systems based on various data including genetic and clinical data, while implementing scalable, efficient software solutions for complex data workflows.  My technical toolkit includes Python, R and cloud‑based platforms, and I adhere to MLOps best practices for deploying and managing machine‑learning models in production.  It includes hands-on experience with a wide variaty of both traditional and deep learning models and algorithms from tree-based ensemble models to large language models (LLMs). Alongside these technical skills, I have cultivated strong project management and leadership abilities, collaborating effectively with cross‑functional teams across academia and industry.


My career has been defined by curiosity, creativity and a commitment to solving complex problems.  I strive to combine rigorous theoretical research with practical applications that benefit society.  This dual focus has guided my work across academia and industry — from developing explainable AI frameworks for healthcare to designing production‑grade AI solutions as an MLOps engineer.

Recent projects such as the **Medical AI Toolbox (MAIT)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIT)) and the **ExplaineR package** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/explainer)) exemplify my commitment to building interpretable AI systems.  Having worked across academia, industry and international collaborations from Europe to Australia, North America and beyond, I bring a global perspective to research and teaching.  These experiences have taught me the value of embracing diverse viewpoints while maintaining scientific rigour.

I remain passionate about ideation, prototyping and driving AI solutions from research to real‑world impact.  With a blend of academic depth and industrial experience, I look forward to advancing knowledge and innovation in engineering and technology.
