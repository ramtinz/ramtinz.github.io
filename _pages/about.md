I'm a research scientist with a PhD in biomedical engineering from **Aalborg University, Denmark** (joint with **Grenoble University, France**). My academic journey began with a **BSc in electrical engineering**, followed by an **MSc in biomedical engineering**. I have industrial experience in data science and machine learning operations (MLOps). Over the past decade, I have contributed to several biomedical research studies, investigating human behavior at the systemic level through measuring and analyzing biosignals, as well as exploring human biology and the immune system using microbiome, genetic, and clinical data.

My career journey also includes extensive software engineering experience, leading and contributing to the design and development of multiple software tools and systems. This includes working with a wide variety of data types and platforms, and implementing scalable, efficient solutions for complex pipelines and workflows. I have extensive experience with programming languages such as Python and R, along with hands-on expertise in cloud-based platforms. In the AI/ML domain, I have worked with a wide variety of models and algorithms, covering the full cycle from design to implementation, including deep learning and generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs).

In research lab settings, I have worked directly with hardware for human experimentation, including devices for biosignal acquisition, as well as the design and implementation of electronic systems for robotics. I have also developed and applied software solutions for simulation studies on diverse systems, ranging from electrophysiology to real-time MIMO control systems. In addition, my work in bioinformatics has included applying advanced biostatistical analyses to a variety of research projects in biomedical science.

Over the years, I have built strong project management and leadership skills, collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I am equally comfortable working independently or as part of a team, adapting quickly to new environments and challenges. I’m passionate about ideation, prototyping, and driving solutions from research to real-world impact.

My research areas over the years include (see the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-pFVNQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">full list of my publications here</a>):

Recent projects such as the **Medical AI Toolbox (MAIT)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIT)) and the **ExplaineR package** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/explainer)) are examples of my contributions to sceintific research based on explainable ML/AI.  Having worked across academia, industry and international collaborations from Europe to Australia, North America and beyond, I bring a global perspective to professional collaborations.
