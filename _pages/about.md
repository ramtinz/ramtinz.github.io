I'm a senior research scientist with a PhD in biomedical engineering from **Aalborg University, Denmark** (joint with **Grenoble University, France**). My academic journey began with a **BSc in electrical engineering**, followed by an **MSc in biomedical engineering**. These degrees have provided a strong foundation in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and biomedical engineering.

Over the past decade I have contributed to designing and developing numerous AI systems based on various data including genetic and clinical data, while implementing scalable, efficient software solutions for complex data workflows. I have hands-on experience in programming (e.g. in Python and R) as well as software workflows and platforms to serve different purposes (e.g. data analysis and discovery or prediction). I adhere to MLOps best practices for deploying and maintaining ML/AI models in production. It includes hands-on experience with a wide variaty of both traditional and deep learning models and algorithms from tree-based ensemble models to large language models (LLMs). Alongside these technical skills, I have developed strong project management and leadership abilities, collaborating effectively with cross‑functional teams across academia and industry.

Curiosity, creativity and a commitment to solving complex problems are parts of my professional career goals. My approach usually is to combine my extensive experience in theoretical research with practical applications that benefit society. This dual focus has guided my work across academia and industry from developing explainable AI frameworks for healthcare to designing production‑grade AI solutions as an MLOps engineer.

My research interests has shifted over the years and it span (see the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-pFVNQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">full list of my publications here</a>):

Recent projects such as the **Medical AI Toolbox (MAIT)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIT)) and the **ExplaineR package** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/explainer)) are examples of my contributions to sceintific research based on explainable ML/AI.  Having worked across academia, industry and international collaborations from Europe to Australia, North America and beyond, I bring a global perspective to professional collaborations.

My passionate is about ideation, prototyping and driving practical solutions from research to real‑world impact. With a blend of academic depth and industrial experience, I look forward to advancing knowledge and innovation in engineering and technology.
