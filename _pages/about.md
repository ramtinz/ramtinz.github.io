I'm a research scientist with a PhD in biomedical engineering from **Aalborg University, Denmark** (joint with **Grenoble University, France**). My academic journey began with a **BSc in electrical engineering**, followed by an **MSc in biomedical engineering**. These degrees and my own research and certification programs have provided a strong foundation in biomedical research including extensive experience in biosignal processing, machine learning, and statistical analyses.

Over the past decade, I have contributed to biomedical research studies investigating human behavior at the systemic level through biosignal analysis, and exploring human biology and the immune system via microbiome, genetic, and clinical data. My career journey also includes extensive software engineering work, leading and contributing to the design and development of advanced software tools and AI systems. I have delivered scalable, efficient solutions for complex data pipelines and workflows, working with diverse datasets and platforms. My expertise spans programming in Python and R, cloud-based infrastructures, and applying MLOps best practices for reliable, maintainable deployments.

Alongside my technical skills, I bring strong project management and leadership experience, collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I’m eager to learn, quick to adapt to new environments, and passionate about ideation, prototyping, and transforming research into impactful real-world solutions.

My research areas over the years include (see the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-pFVNQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">full list of my publications here</a>):

Recent projects such as the **Medical AI Toolbox (MAIT)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIT)) and the **ExplaineR package** ([GitHub](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/explainer)) are examples of my contributions to sceintific research based on explainable ML/AI.  Having worked across academia, industry and international collaborations from Europe to Australia, North America and beyond, I bring a global perspective to professional collaborations.
